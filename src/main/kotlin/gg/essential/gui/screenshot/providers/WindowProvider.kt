    /**
     * Attempts to provide all elements in the given windows.
     *
     * It is up to each particular implementation to specify whether this operation will block until all elements
     * can be provided. If so, the returned map must contain all elements in the given windows, otherwise only
     * elements already available will be returned.
     *
     * The caller may indicate that it is not really interested in a particular set of items by passing them in
     * [optional]. The values for these may be returned if they are already available but the provider should not make
     * any extra effort to provide them if they are not because the caller will likely just ignore them (probably
     * because there is already a cached version for them higher up in the chain).
     * This provider may also purge entries for these items from its cache, just like as if they were not being
     * requested in the first place.
     *
     * The provider should make an attempt to load elements in the order in which the windows are given, with each
     * window loading from low index to high index unless backwards is `true`.
     *
     * A provider may pre-load further elements or keep no longer required elements in a cache. It may use the windows
     * to decide which elements are likely to be required in the future.
     * As such, this method should ideally be called once every frame, even when the windows have not changed, to
     * allow the implementation to make internal progress.
     *
     * If an empty list of windows is passed, the provider must eventually clean up all resources it directly or
     * indirectly holds, even if there are no further calls to this method.
     *
     * Implementations must generally be thread safe unless they have special requirements.
     * Ideally they should allow multiple concurrent requests but they may also simply lock the whole method.
