/**
 * Arrows are rendered on the player by picking a random model part from the list of all model parts ever constructed
 * for that model and then rendering the arrow somewhere on it.
 * The player model however overwrites some model parts of its parent class, thereby "leaking" the originals. Meaning
 * they will still be in the list of all parts even though they're no longer used. This can cause arrows to float in
 * places where visually there's nothing for them to stick to.
 * This is a vanilla bug but it's particularly obvious with emotes, so we'll fix it.
 *
 * Similar issue happens with the cape: MC doesn't actually position it using the regular model part offset/rotation
 * fields, it - for some unknown reason - uses raw GL. As such, arrows stuck in the cape will similarly float in places
 * where they shouldn't be.
 *
 * Similarly, the ears part is only positioned if it is also rendered, so once again, arrows stuck in it will be
 * floating where they shouldn't be if the ears are never rendered. This one however is fixed by setting the ears to
 * match the head in {@link gg.essential.model.backend.minecraft.PlayerPoseKt#applyTo(PlayerPose, ModelBiped)}
