         * Chosen such that it does not conflict with STUN nor TURN nor QUIC nor PseudoTCP.
         *
         * As per the NEW TEXT in RFC7983, STUN and TURN can be identified by the value of the first byte being 0..3 and
         * 64..79 respectively.
         * As per section 17.3.1 of RFC9000, a QUIC Version 1 packet that has the first bit set to 0 must have the second
         * bit set to 1. As such, values in the range 0..63 can never be valid QUICv1 packets.
         * As per implementation, the first four bytes of a PseudoTCP packet are the conversation id which is 0 by default.
         *
         * As such, we should be safe to choose any value from 4..64. We chose 16 because according to RFC7983 that's
         * allocated to ZRTP, which we don't use, so it should most definitely be free.
