    The enum declaration order is in the order in which the sides are determined to be default.
    The reasoning behind the order is that if we do have all 4 sides, we probably want "FRONT" as the default.
    If we do not have "FRONT", we probably want one of the sides, which keep "LEFT" as a default from before.
    If nothing else, we use "BACK".

            The mod technically supports all 4 sides to be present, but in most cases sides will be left/right or front/back only.
            That is why we cannot have a single default side, we must pick the default based on the sides available.
            The order in which a default side is picked is the order of declaration on the sides in the enum, see the comment above.
